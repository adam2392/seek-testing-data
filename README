SEEK Testing Dataset
====================



# Sourcedata
For each subject, there was a raw EDF file, which was converted into the BrainVision format with `mne_bids`. Each subject with SEEG implantation, also has an Excel table, called `electrode_layout.xlsx`, which outlines where the clinicians marked each electrode anatomically. Note that there is no rigorous atlas applied, so the main points of interest are: `WM`, `GM`, `VENTRICLE`, `CSF`, and `OUT`, which represent white-matter, gray-matter, ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid and outside the brain. WM, Ventricle, CSF and OUT were removed channels from further analysis. These were labeled in the corresponding BIDS `channels.tsv` sidecar file as `status=bad`.

# Derivatives
Derivatives include the `freesurfer/` output, which corresponds to the
`SUBJECTS_DIR` environment variable in FreeSurfer. Inside this directory, it would be
organized as:

    freesurfer/
        <subject_id>/
            mri/
            acpc/
            elecs/
            ct/
            ...
